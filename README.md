# Scalable-Starbucks-Order-Processor

## Description

Scalable-Starbucks-Order-Processor is a comprehensive Starbucks order processing system, developed as part of my university coursework at San Jose State University. It demonstrates a scalable and distributed system capable of handling complex workflows associated with processing orders. This project incorporates a variety of technologies including Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Spring MVC, MySQL Database 8.0, RabbitMQ, and Kong API Gateway.

## Features

- Configured scalable cloud deployment on GCP using an external load balancer for the cashier's app and an internal load balancer for the Starbucks API.
- Leveraged Java and Spring for building scalable micro-services and designed APIs that interacted effectively with different services.
- Utilized RabbitMQ to support asynchronous order processing, extending the Starbucks API's capabilities.
- Enabled continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), making the project automatically deploy from GitHub commits to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
